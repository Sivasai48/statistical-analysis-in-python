# statistical-analysis-in-python
This repository contains Python code and resources for performing various statistical analyses using real-world datasets. The focus is on demonstrating fundamental statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing, linear regression, and data visualization.<br>
Overview
Statistical analysis is an essential tool for data science and analytics. It helps in understanding relationships between variables, identifying trends, and making informed decisions. In this repository, we explore key statistical methods, including:

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, etc.)
Hypothesis testing (t-tests)
Linear regression (single and multiple variables)
Data visualization<br>
Dataset Used
In this repository, we primarily work with a Heart Disease Prediction dataset, which contains various medical attributes such as:

Age
Blood Pressure (BP)
Cholesterol
Maximum Heart Rate (Max HR)
ST depression
Number of vessels fluoroscopy
Exercise-induced angina
Chest pain type
EKG results
Thallium scan results
Sex
FBS over 120<br>
Key Topics and Concepts
1. Descriptive Statistics
We calculate basic statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance to summarize the features in the dataset.<br>
2. Hypothesis Testing
We perform hypothesis tests to compare means of specific features (e.g., comparing the average cholesterol level to a baseline of 200).<br>
3. Linear Regression
We explore relationships between two or more variables using simple and multiple linear regression.<br>
4. Multiple Linear Regression
We extend the regression analysis to include multiple independent variables (e.g., Age, Cholesterol, Max HR) to predict blood pressure.<br>
5. Data Visualization (without seaborn)
Using matplotlib, we visualize the relationships between variables and plot regression lines.<br>
